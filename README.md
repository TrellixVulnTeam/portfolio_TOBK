#My portfolio Websites

-- Created with basic HTML, CSS(SASS), and a little bit of JavaScript

-- Created from complete Scratch

-- In order to hone in my skills, thought this would be a great way to start

-- Great way to start getting used to Git repo, updating, bug fixes, etc

##Side note

--typewriter.js is from tutorial video that I found Youtube, followed along with the video to make it work within my project.
